Changes in Version 0.5-1

  o Error/bug when using factor() terms in neEffdecomp: fixed
  o neWeight now returns a warning when trying to specify more than one mediator (e.g. 'nMed = 2'), as joint mediated effects are only implemented for the imputation-based approach.
  o Coding error for outcome variable 'UPB' in UPBdata dataset: fixed (up to version 0.5-0 'UPB' was a binary variable indicating whether the individual reported having displayed at least 4 events of unwanted pursuit behavior; while it stated to indicate whether the individual reported having displayed any unwanted pursuit behavior(s) towards the ex-partner)
  

Changes in Version 0.5-0

  o Robust standard errors based on the sandwich estimator as alternative for bootstrap SEs (option 'se = "robust"' in neModel function)
  o Advanced options for effect decomposition (neEffdecomp function now allows to specify reference exposure levels and covariate levels via 'xRef' and 'covLev' arguments, respectively)
  o Additional option to weight for multicategorical variables (either via inverse-probability-of-treatment weighting for multivariate exposures or via ratio-of-mediator-probability weighting for multivariate mediators) using 'vglm' from the 'VGAM' package as model fitting function
  o Vignettes with more details added
  o Ratio-of-mediator-probability weights can be extracted from the expanded dataset object via 'weights' function
  o Minor changes to UPBdata (different versions of variables + variable 'initiator' added)
  o Bugs in neEffdecomp fixed: error returned if imputation model did not contain covariates, 'ci.type' argument can now be specified
  o Bug in Anova() applied to neModel object fixed
